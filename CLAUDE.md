# Squared Away — project memory

**Read this first. The full original brief is `docs/BRIEF.md` — read it when starting a new milestone.**

## Product in one paragraph

An AI inbox operator for small trade contractors (carpentry, plumbing, electrical; 1–15 people, US).
Owner connects Gmail. We triage each inbound email (quote request, customer question, scheduling,
invoice/payment, complaint, supplier/vendor, noise), draft replies in the owner's own voice as
**real Gmail drafts**, and hold every draft in an approval queue (Send reply / Edit / Discard).
We chase quiet quotes/invoices (max 2 nudges per thread, ever), send a morning digest, and later
offer opt-in autopilot for low-risk categories. **Core promise: nothing leaves the inbox without the
owner's okay.** When slick and trustworthy conflict, pick trustworthy.

Users are non-technical, on a phone, one-handed, in sunlight, maybe wearing gloves:
mobile first (375px), 44px tap targets, plain words, fast.

## Commercial flow (gates real behavior — enforce server-side)

`invited` → `evaluating` (3 days, **sending blocked in code → 403**) → `evaluation_expired`
(read-only) → `setup_paid` ($499 once; sending unblocked; setup call pending) → `active`
→ `past_due` / `canceled` / `paused`. Plans: Solo $99 (1 mailbox), Crew $199 (3, autopilot),
Company $299 (10, priority support). All prices live in `src/config/pricing.ts`.
**Never change pricing or the commercial flow without asking Davi.**

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, TS strict) · Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui (base-ui primitives) · Postgres on Neon

- Drizzle (migrations in `/drizzle`) · Auth.js Google provider (offline access) · Inngest (every
  job idempotent) · Anthropic SDK (model IDs only in `src/config/models.ts`; prompt caching on
  business + voice profile) · Resend · Stripe · Sentry · Vercel · Vitest + Playwright. pnpm.

> Next 16 has breaking changes vs. older training data — check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`
> before using an unfamiliar API (see AGENTS.md).

## Layout

```
src/app/            routes (App Router)
src/components/ui/  shadcn components (edited: all button sizes ≥44px, no red destructive)
src/components/brand/  Headline (signature serif-over-heavy), Wordmark (placeholder)
src/config/         site.ts (business facts), models.ts, pricing.ts
src/db/             schema.ts, lazy db() client
src/styles/theme.css   THE theme file — every color/token
tests/unit/         Vitest
tests/e2e/          Playwright (mobile 375px + desktop projects)
docs/               BRIEF.md, SETUP.md, google-verification.md (M11), legal drafts
```

## Commands

`pnpm dev` · `pnpm lint` · `pnpm format` · `pnpm typecheck` (runs `next typegen` first) ·
`pnpm test` · `pnpm build && pnpm test:e2e` · `pnpm db:generate` / `pnpm db:migrate`.
In a sandbox with preinstalled Chromium: `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium pnpm test:e2e`.

## Conventions

- Buttons name the action ("Send reply", never "Submit"); toast uses the same word ("Reply sent.").
- Two-tone only. No red/green/blue. Status = weight, position, charcoal/off-white inversion
  (`.sa-inverted`). All tokens in `src/styles/theme.css`.
- Every major heading uses `<Headline serif="…," heavy="….">`.
- Never log tokens, email bodies, or customer personal details. Log prompt version, model,
  tokens, latency only.
- Every gate (sending, plan limits, autopilot guardrails) is enforced server-side and has a test.
- Business facts from `src/config/site.ts`; `SUPPORT_EMAIL` and `APP_URL` from env, never hardcoded.
- Write tests with features. Guardrail tests are the product.

## Decisions

- **pnpm** as package manager (lockfile committed, CI uses `--frozen-lockfile`).
- **Next 16.3 / React 19.2 / Tailwind 4 / Zod 4** — latest stable at scaffold time.
- shadcn init installed a stray `cn` npm package; replaced with the standard clsx + tailwind-merge
  `cn` in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
- No OS dark mode. The brand is a light paper surface with charcoal inversions; a system dark theme
  would muddy the "inversion means status" rule.
- shadcn `destructive` maps to charcoal, not red; destructive actions are made clear by wording and a
  confirmation step.
- Haiku ID: using dated snapshot `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (as specified; alias is
  `claude-haiku-4-5`). Sonnet: `claude-sonnet-5`. Verified 2026-09-28 — unchanged from the brief.
- `db()` is created lazily so build/test don't need `DATABASE_URL`.
- Playwright's mobile project uses Chromium at 375×812 (not WebKit) to keep CI fast and single-browser.
- Favicon and wordmark are text placeholders until Davi's icon pack arrives (`public/brand/`).
- `/api/health` returns `{ ok, service, commit }` — used by Playwright's webServer check and for
  deploy verification.
